# BiliBili-Subtitles-Selector
With the use of AI and OpenSubtitles, this tool helps you add subtitles to anime on BiliBili.com. ***Warning*** I have not fully tested the script. The only machine I have tested this on is a Windows 11, Chromium based browser, with OpenSubtitles VIP account. Your results may vary.

## Install the Userscript
1. Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) for your browser.
2. Click below to install the script:

    ***Note:*** If nothing happens, ensure Tampermonkey is installed and active.

3. Get your OpenSubtitles api token from [here](https://www.opensubtitles.com/en/users/profile)

4. Go to an anime on BiliBili and go to any episode. (Specially the domain has to be https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/*)

5. Click login in the bottom right and put in your opensubtitles API Token.
